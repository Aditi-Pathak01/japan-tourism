          What is a cherry blossom festival? Japan's cherry blossom festivals
          are a centuries-old cultural tradition. Taking place throughout the
          entire country, these festivals are commemorated with picnics,
          parties, sake, and viewing parties, also referred to as hanami, which
          means “viewing flowers.”

          <span>2) Aomori Nebuta Matsuri </span><br />
          Where: Aomori-shi, Aomori:- Accompany the huge, vibrantly colored
          doll-shaped lanterns known as Nebuta as they are paraded through the
          city of Aomori at nighttime. The festival is played out to the sounds
          of drums, flutes, cymbals and dancers leaping to cries of “Rassera.”
          Rental costumes are required to participate.

          <span>3) Kesencho Kenka Tanabata Matsuri</span> <br />
          Where? Rikuzentakata-shi, Iwate:- Large floats are pulled around the
          town before being crashed into each other in a stirring finale. This
          festival has a very long history, but serves a greater purpose in more
          recent times as it aims to raise the spirits of those who suffered in
          the massive earthquake and subsequent tsunami that struck the area on
          March 11, 2011.

          The Gion Matsuri, or Gion Festival, is a midsummer celebration in
          Kyoto, Japan that takes place over the entire month of July. It's one
          of Japan's three biggest festivals, along with the Kanda Matsuri in
          Tokyo and the Tenjin Matsuri in Osaka, and is considered the largest
          and most luxurious of the three
